WEBVTT - Backmarket "Tree"

00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.250
This is Anna.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.750
Anna decided against a new laptop

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.000
but for an all-round renewed one on Back Market.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.250
That's good for the environment

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.000
and her wallet.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.750
Anna really "rejoices herself...

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.000
...a branch".

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.750
Do it like Anna.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.000
Be stupid happy!
About renewed.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.150
Top tech tested by experts.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.000
More sustainable.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.500
And up to 70% cheaper than new.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
On Back Market.
