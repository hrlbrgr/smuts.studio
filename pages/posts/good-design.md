# Good Design

![A x/y chart of Good Design and Fancy Design](../../public/images/good-design.png)

The other day I was chatting with [Paco](https://paco.me) about this. Sometimes we’ve been chasing the fancy things too much and forgot about the goal. And also, “goodness” doesn’t scale linearly with the complexity of the design.

In the past years, we ditched all the lights, shadows and textures in our designs. And now we are slowly adding them back. This is not an argument about flat design and skeuomorphism design, neither a step back but actually moving forward by understanding design better.

It’s like the [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) algorithm. Over time, we move and try, again and again, we seem to be closer to the best result in our sights.

Even though, when we talk about good design, we are usually talking about a moving target. We get bored with the same aesthetics every once in a while, and the environment changes rapidly as well. The term “trend”, describes the idea of good design in people’s mind at a certain time.

The variable is **time**. When chasing the trend, we are chasing a moving target. We do new designs every year for the same old things.

I want to decorrelate time from my design. I want to find the non-exsiting _good design_, that is beyond the past, now and future. As Dieter Rams said, _good design is timeless_.
