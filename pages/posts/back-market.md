Back Market is France’s latest unicorn – the mother of all marketplaces for refurbished tech and a company with a mission that’s well worth supporting. They’re huge in France already, but not quite known in Germany yet. Time to change that. With a fun campaign that focuses on the absurd joy you feel when you buy refurbished tech. And leaves enough room to explain to the dumb Germans what Back Market really is.

### A project we like a lot

This project is particularly dear to our hearts because it was developed in [a new process](https://www.sprintworks.de) as part of a small and dynamic embedded creative unit in direct collaboration with the client – an absolute pleasure, an insane creative sprint. And a result to be happy with!

Don't just take our word for it though. Horizont, one of Germany's leading papers for the marketing industry, [described the campaign](https://www.horizont.net/agenturen/nachrichten/freu-dich-bescheuert-ueber-erneuert-ex-publicis-chefs-entwickeln-erste-deutschland-kampagne-fuer-back-market-192859?crefresh=1) pretty well:

> In the case of Back Market, not only has a humorous campaign been created, but above all a catchy claim: "Freu dich bescheuert! Über erneuert!" has real cult potential and gets to the heart of the online retailer's USP.

Couldn't have said it better ourselves.
