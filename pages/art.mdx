# Art

I enjoy photography as well as creating art with code, you can find some of my work here:

import Image from "next/image"
import photography from "../public/images/photography.jpeg"
import creativeCoding from "../public/images/creative-coding.jpeg"

<a href="https://works.shud.in" title="Photography" target="_blank" className="figure">
  <Image src={photography} alt="Photography" placeholder="blur"/>
</a>

<p style={{ textAlign: "right" }}>[Photography ↗](https://works.shud.in)</p>

And creative coding projects:
