# Shu Ding

I’m a designer and developer based in Berlin, currently building [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) at [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Previously worked as a software engineer at Microsoft. I enjoy finding and solving problems.

Started programming in high school and has since spent 4 years on algorithm competitions, worked as a freelance developer in Shanghai, and got a BSc degree in Computer Science from Fudan University. I have been contributing to [open source](https://github.com/shuding) since 2013, as well as making games, [creative coding](/art), and HCI experiments. Notable work:

- Created [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app) and leading the project since 2019. It now has [millions](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=swr&from=2019-01-01) monthly downloads.
- Created [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori), which powers [Vercel OG Image Generation](https://twitter.com/vercel/status/1579561293069316096).
- Created [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) for building better documentation with Next.js.
- Helped build the inital version of Next.js Live (now Vercel Comments) and React Server Components in Next.js.
- Designed and implemented the early Next.js website in [2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181227215910/https://nextjs.org).
- Created [Mak](https://inns.studio/mak) for better writing experience.

My other projects: [Y86](https://y86.js.org), [Metaballs](https://metaballs.vercel.app), [COBE](https://cobe.vercel.app), [Tilg](https://github.com/shuding/tilg), [CC](https://cc.shud.in), [VRS](https://v-r-s.vercel.app/edit/?id=1), [Flappy Cube](https://github.com/shuding/flappy-cube), [Inns](https://inns.studio), [赤徑](https://twitter.com/crimsonpathway), [more...](https://github.com/shuding?tab=repositories)
