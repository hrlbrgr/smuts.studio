		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>Advertising and PR feel like a dirty thing. Especially if youâ€™re trying to do good in the world. Because doing good often also means beginning to question our consumption in a commercialised reality.</p>
		<p>We think the dirt and the beauty can coexist. In fact, we think there's a way to use the smutsiga arts of advertising and PR to support people, products, services and companies that want to leave a more meaningful mark on the world. We're here to help them grow and prosper.</p>
